 Architecture
The architecture of the project is outlined in the `architecture/architecture-diagram.png` file. It illustrates the high-level structure and the interaction between different components of the system.

 Data Models
The data models for the project are detailed in the `data-models/erd-diagram.png` file. The `schema.sql` file provides the SQL schema for creating the tables used in the project.
